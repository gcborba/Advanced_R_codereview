Gauge stations: 
data: Hydrological indices from the daily water level of the Amazon Basin

Metrics measured based on raw daily water level from each tributary river from the Amazon Basin. 

Main goal: select the most important hydrological indices to the fish catch 

See below the description of each variables in each column:
